# Rule-Generator

This is a fully-fuctioning generator for any [Elementary Cellular Automation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton).
Hopefully I will make this easier to take user input and then probably just cycle through all rules.

### How to use
In line 6, there is a constructor for the Cellular class. This is where you insert (in the first argument) the rule number you want to generate.
Just change this and run the code!
